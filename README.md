## Contributions

Please contribute your evilness. We need to have a subtle balance
on how insidious and evil we are, for example something 
like [trump](https://github.com/romainfrancois/trump) would be too much, 
R must still be usable but slowly drive people to insanity.

Everything should stay in the `evil.R` file, and we must be discreet
when adding an evilness.
