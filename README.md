## Contributions

Please contribute your evilness. We need to have a subtle balance
on how insidious and evil we are, for example something 
like [trump](https://github.com/romainfrancois/trump) would be too much, 
R must still be usable but slowly drive people to insanity.

## Usage

```r
library(evil)
```
