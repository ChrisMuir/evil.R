# evil: Evil Tricks for R

Collection of subtle tricks to slowly drive R users insane. 

This is not a package because package loading prevent some of the evilness 
that we want to achieve. 

## Usage

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romainfrancois/evil.R/master/evil.R")
```

## Contributions

Please contribute your evilness. We need to have a subtle balance
on how insidious and evil we are, for example something 
like [trump](https://github.com/romainfrancois/trump) would be too much, 
R must still be usable but slowly drive people to insanity.

Everything should stay in the `evil.R` file, and we must be discreet
when adding an evilness (hence this is not a package).
